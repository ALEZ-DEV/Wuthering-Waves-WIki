# Wuthering Waves Wiki

This is the wiki for the future game Wuthering Waves

## How the project work

This Ruby on rails project will simply render some file located in the folder `./pages/` of the project
for the moment everyone can create pages, but we will add a admin to allow creators to create page and if the guest is not connected as admin, it will be read only
